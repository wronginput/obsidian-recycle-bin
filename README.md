## ⚠️ Important: Trash Location Setting

**This plugin ONLY works when Obsidian is set to use its own `.trash` folder.**

If you're using System Trash (macOS Bin / Windows Recycle Bin), deleted files go to your OS and this plugin cannot access them.

**To enable this plugin:**
1. Go to **Settings → Recycle Bin** (this plugin's settings)
2. Change "Deleted files location" to **"Obsidian .trash folder"**

The plugin settings will be greyed out until this is configured correctly.
